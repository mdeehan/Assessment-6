# Assessment-6
Wheel of Fortune Project

Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to develop my Python skills. This project tests many of the fundamental skills of the Python language.
Game Play:
Three players will compete to see who can obtain the most cash within two rounds. The winner will advance to the final round. Here, the player will have one guess at a top prize. 
Issues:
I am currently having some issues with the game play while loops. Some of my final round functions may also need some tuning up.
